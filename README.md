# Description
The project's aim is to use biometrics and machine learning to enable the processes of detection, segmentation, polarization and encoding through a low-quality device such as a webcam, and to show how powerful such techniques can be in the contest of computer vision.
The code was made using the Python programming language and makes use of powerful approaches such as the "Viola-Jones object detection framework" and "Haar Cascades"
